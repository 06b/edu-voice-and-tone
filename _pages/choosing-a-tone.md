# Choosing a tone

As we mentioned before, your voice is a constant, but your tone is a variable. Consider the following: If you’re having an irredeemably terrible day, you might get peeved at a store associate who chirpily (and repeatedly) asks if they can help you with anything. Instead of picking up on your nonverbal — or perhaps verbal — cues, this associate is tone-deaf. The associate maintained a consistently _helpful_ voice, but they failed to shift their tone from _energetic_ to _restrained_. As a result, their message (however valuable or well-intended) is lost on you.

To avoid going the way of the associate, think about your users’ needs in different situations. Use these needs to determine your tone.

Let’s consider three examples that target three different reader groups. Obituaries, technical blog posts, and marketing emails targeted at newly engaged couples have vastly different tones. Why? The three types of writing correspond to audiences in three highly different emotional states.

    <tr>
        <td>Obituary of a prominent community member</td>
        <td>People who knew (or knew of) the deceased</td>
        <td>Respectful, reverent, somber</td>
        <td>“Professor Pelham was respected by his colleagues and revered by students, many of whom would wake before dawn on registration day to ensure gaining entry to his classes. His wit, gentle humor, and compassion left their mark on everyone he talked to.”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Blog post announcing open source documentation guide</td>
        <td>Developers and other readers with a strong tech background</td>
        <td>Direct, impartial</td>
        <td>“The <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/07/29/style-guide-for-open-source-documentation/">Open Source Style Guide</a> is a comprehensive handbook for writing clear, accessible, and user-friendly documentation so that your open source code repositories are accessible both internally and externally.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Marketing email from the boutique bridal department of a well-known clothing company </td>
        <td>Newly engaged women (ages 28 through 33)</td>
        <td>Enthusiastic, earnest, bubbly</td>
        <td>“Say ‘I do!’ to 25% off. Now through July 3rd, take an additional 25% off all bridal wear and accessories. Celebrate your big day in style (and get a jumpstart on your honeymoon fund!).”</td>
    </tr>
   </table>

   If you’re having trouble finding an appropriate tone, try reframing the situation: How would you _talk_ to a friend who’s in the same situation as your target user? Remembering that written communication is a conversation can help you settle on the best tone for your purpose.
