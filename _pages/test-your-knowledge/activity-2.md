# Activity two: Shifting tone for a different medium

The excerpt below was taken from one of USCIS’s pages about rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizens. Its purpose? To provide information to folks who are considering the naturalization process.

For this activity, imagine you’re an author for a blog targeted at the same audience (citizenship seekers). Rewrite the excerpt, keeping reader needs and your medium in mind.

>_Citizenship is the common thread that connects all Americans. We are a nation bound not by race or religion, but by the shared values of freedom, liberty, and equality._

>_Throughout our history, the United States has welcomed newcomers from all over the world. The contributions of immigrants have helped shape and define the country we know today. More than 200 years after our founding, naturalized citizens are still an important part of our democracy. By becoming a U.S. citizen, you too will have a voice in how our nation is governed._

>_The decision to apply is a significant one. Citizenship offers many benefits and equally important responsibilities. By applying, you are demonstrating your commitment to this country and our form of government._
