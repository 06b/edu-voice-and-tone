# Activity three: Shifting tone for a different audience

The excerpt below (from everykidinapark.gov) is targeted at a fourth-grade audience. Imagine you’re creating a new page for parents. 

Rewrite the content below, keeping your new audience needs in mind.

>_Hey fourth graders! See America’s natural wonders and historic sites for free._

>_Fourth graders: This is for you! Explore ancient dwellings. See a waterfall taller than a building. Follow the steps below, and you'll be visiting the outdoors in no time:_


>>_1. Get and print fourth-grade passes to our national lands and waters._
>>_2. Plan a trip. It's a good idea to involve your parent or guardian in this._


>_Marvel at the St. Louis Arch, the Florida Keys, and the Frederick Douglass house. Listen to wolves howl. Walk in dinosaur tracks. Look up into the inky night sky, and reach for the stars!_


>_These sites belong to all of us — including you._
