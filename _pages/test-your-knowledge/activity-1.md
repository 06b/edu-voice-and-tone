# Activity one: Identifying audience and tone

We’ve selected four excerpts from different types of content.

Read each, and then try to identify the intended audience and describe the tone.


## **Excerpt 1:**

> _SEC. FEC. FERC. FCC. CDC._

> _The “alphabet soup” of government acronyms is a well-documented frustration — both among federal employees and the public we serve. Abbreviations can be confusing. They mystify meaning. They read like riddles._

> _And they’re one of things we get asked about the most._

> _We have an acronyms section in our Content Guide, a resource we heartily recommend. Acronyms and abbreviations also have a ton of associated history and nuance, which we’re shedding light on here, hopefully to encourage other authors and agencies to think carefully about how they use them in digital tools._

## **Excerpt 2:**

> _Acronyms often confuse readers. Avoid them whenever possible._

> _If an acronym is necessary for future reference, spell the full word and follow with the acronym in parentheses on the first reference. For example, The General Services Administration (GSA)._

> _Some acronyms are more recognizable than their full spellings. For example, NASA, NAACP, FBI. In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable, at the writer’s discretion._

> _At the writer’s discretion, refer to organizations on second reference with a shortened name instead of an acronym. For example, use Labor in place of Department of Labor, rather than DOL._
