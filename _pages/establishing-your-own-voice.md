# Establishing your own voice

Whether you realize it or not, you already have a unique voice; the tricky part can be classifying it and pinning it down.

To describe your voice — which, in turn, will allow you to diagram it, create guidelines around it, and make it reproducible — you’ll need to do some investigation and self reflection. Ask yourself these questions:

* **What are my core values?** Your voice is a reflection of your core values. Before you craft a voice, consider the values your organization represents and how you can translate these into stylistic patterns. If you’re part of a young organization that hasn’t yet codified its values, you might use this opportunity to start that conversation. Crafting a voice before you’ve determined your organization’s values can be dangerous — your voice might not reflect what you eventually decide on. Along the same lines, if your organization is undergoing a large-scale values overhaul, you’ll want to make sure your organizational voice reflects your new values. 

* **Who is my audience?** In writing, as elsewhere, your audience is paramount — without them, you’d have no reason to write. Put yourself in their situation and think about the stylistic traits that might appeal to them. Remember, your voice doesn’t need to appeal to everyone (and, in fact, shouldn’t — cure-alls cure nothing, as the old saying goes).

Use your answers to these questions to craft a description of your voice. Once you’ve come up with your description, look it over and identify any contradictions or holes (never a good thing). While voices should be nuanced, they should also be cohesive.
