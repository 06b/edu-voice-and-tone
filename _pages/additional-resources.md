# There's more to learn: additional resources

Thanks for joining us for this tutorial: We hope you’re more comfortable differentiating voice and tone and that you feel good about choosing the right tone for a given piece of content.

If you’d like to read more about voice and tone, check out these great resources — they’re some that we return to again and again:

* **[Nicole Fenton’s voice attribute activity](http://nicolefenton.com/honest-marketing/)**: In her workshops on honest marketing, Nicole Fenton details how to create a list of voice attributes. Defining what’s important to you and what you want to communicate makes it easier for you to describe your voice. 
* **[MailChimp’s voice and tone guide](http://voiceandtone.com/)**: This beautifully designed tool allows you to select different content types and learn more about what the user might be feeling while reading them, along with examples of tones appropriate to those content types. Super simple to use, this is a great quick reference for folks charged with creating diverse types of content.
* **[The nonviolent communication (NVC) framework for feelings](http://thrivinglifenvc.org/feelings)**: Pinpointing the most appropriate tone for a piece of content starts with identifying what your readers might be feeling when they read that content. This list of feelings is broken into two categories — feelings you experience when your needs are being met and when they aren’t. 
* **[Jeff Goins’ voice activities](http://goinswriter.com/writing-voice/)**: Use author Jeff Goins’ ten-step exercise to pinpoint your authorial voice. The “steps” are actually discrete activities and can be undertaken in any order, FYI. Do all ten for best results. 
* If you’re still a little confused about voice and tone, **[Wheaton College](http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Services/Writing-Center/Writing-Resources/Style-Diction-Tone-and-Voice)** provides an excellent breakdown of those — and more — writing components. 
* Even **[Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/3029356/work-smart/the-best-examples-questions-and-guides-to-find-your-social-media-marketing-voice)** has weighed in on the voice and tone discussion.
